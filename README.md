# 🧩 CPP05 — Repetition and Exceptions

Deepening **C++ skills — repetition structures, exception handling, and robust class design**.

Welcome to **CPP05**, the sixth module of the 42 **C++ Modules**, focusing on **loops, iterative logic, and exception handling** in C++. This module emphasizes writing **robust, safe, and maintainable code** that handles errors gracefully.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

**CPP05** emphasizes:

* Repetition structures (`for`, `while`, `do-while`) and iteration logic
* Exception handling and error management
* Validating user input and handling invalid states
* Clean, maintainable, and safe C++ code
* Combining iterative logic with class design and modular programming

The module builds on previous C++ modules, preparing you for **reliable, production-quality C++ programs**.

## 📘 Exercises Overview

* **ex00 — Mommy, when I grow up, I want to be a bureaucrat!**
  *Implement loops and iteration logic to process data; practice proper error checking and handling of invalid input.*

* **ex01 — Form up, maggots!**
  *Use repetition structures in class methods and standalone functions; apply exception handling to maintain program stability.*

* **ex02 — No, you need form 28B, not 28C…**
  *Extend iterative logic to handle multiple cases; implement robust error handling using `try` / `catch` blocks.*

* **ex03 — At least this beats coffee-making**
  *Combine repetition and exceptions in practical scenarios; ensure safe memory and resource management; validate program correctness under all edge cases.*
